A basic 3D rendering engine built using Haskell's Gloss package

I wrote the code with gloss ver. 1.13.2.1, though most versions should work.

To run use `stack run` in the same folder as this file

Once the program is running, use QWE / ASD to rotate the object, and ZX to zoom in and out on it

To add your own mesh, change `object` in Main.hs to your object, the default object is a red cube in order to show off the shading functions

To close the program close the window.
